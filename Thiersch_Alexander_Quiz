# John, Paul and Mary need to take turn to walk their dog this Feburary 2022. 
# Please print out a schedule for the entire month so that everyone knows the schedule.  
# John will start first on Feb 1 (which is a Tuesday).
# You might find this useful: 
# print("text", end='') 
# will not advance to the next line. The next print statement will print at the end of "text".
# On the other hand, print() will create a new line.
# The printout should look like this: 
#
#   Sun     Mon     Tue     Wed     Thu     Fri     Sat   
#                  1-John  2-Paul  3-Mary  4-John  5-Paul 
#  6-Mary  7-John  8-Paul  9-Mary 10-John 11-Paul 12-Mary 
# 13-John 14-Paul 15-Mary 16-John 17-Paul 18-Mary 19-John 
# 20-Paul 21-Mary 22-John 23-Paul 24-Mary 25-John 26-Paul 
# 27-Mary 28-John 
# 
# Please keep the spacing/alignment easy to read for John, Paul, and Mary.
